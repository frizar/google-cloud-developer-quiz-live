It is used for event\n      planning and organizing sporting events, and for businesses to connect\n      with their local communities. HipLocal launched recently in a few\n      neighborhoods in Dallas and is rapidly growing into a global phenomenon.\n      Its unique style of hyper-local community communication and business\n      outreach is in demand around the world.<br /><br />Executive Statement\n      -<br />We are the number one local community app; it's time to take our\n      local community services global. Our venture capital investors want to see\n      rapid growth and the same great experience for new local and virtual\n      communities that come online, whether their members are 10 or 10000 miles\n      away from each other.<br /><br />Solution Concept -<br />HipLocal wants to\n      expand their existing service, with updated functionality, in new regions\n      to better serve their global customers. They want to hire and train a new\n      team to support these regions in their time zones. They will need to\n      ensure that the application scales smoothly and provides clear uptime\n      data.<br /><br />Existing Technical Environment -<br />HipLocal's\n      environment is a mix of on-premises hardware and infrastructure running in\n      Google Cloud Platform. The HipLocal team understands their application\n      well, but has limited experience in global scale applications. Their\n      existing technical environment is as follows:<br />* Existing APIs run on\n      Compute Engine virtual machine instances hosted in GCP.<br />* State is\n      stored in a single instance MySQL database in GCP.<br />* Data is exported\n      to an on-premises Teradata/Vertica data warehouse.<br />* Data analytics\n      is performed in an on-premises Hadoop environment.<br />* The application\n      has no logging.<br />* There are basic indicators of uptime; alerts are\n      frequently fired when the APIs are unresponsive.<br /><br />Business\n      Requirements -<br />HipLocal's investors want to expand their footprint\n      and support the increase in demand they are seeing. Their requirements\n      are:<br />* Expand availability of the application to new regions.<br />*\n      Increase the number of concurrent users that can be supported.<br />*\n      Ensure a consistent experience for users when they travel to different\n      regions.<br />* Obtain user activity metrics to better understand how to\n      monetize their product.<br />* Ensure compliance with regulations in the\n      new regions (for example, GDPR).<br />* Reduce infrastructure management\n      time and cost.<br />* Adopt the Google-recommended practices for cloud\n      computing.<br /><br />Technical Requirements -<br />* The application and\n      backend must provide usage metrics and monitoring.<br />* APIs require\n      strong authentication and authorization.<br />* Logging must be increased,\n      and data should be stored in a cloud analytics platform.<br />* Move to\n      serverless architecture to facilitate elastic scaling.<br />* Provide\n      authorized access to internal apps in a secure manner.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: 'CaseStudy',\n\n  data() {\n    return {\n      showCaseStudy: false,\n    };\n  },\n};\n</script>\n\n<style lang=\"scss\" scoped>\n.case-study {\n  .case-study__button-wrapper {\n    display: flex;\n    align-items: center;\n    justify-content: flex-end;\n\n    .case-study__button {\n      background-color: #ccc;\n      border: 1px solid #000;\n      border-radius: 4px;\n      color: #000;\n      padding: 4px 8px;\n\n      &:hover {\n        background-color: #000;\n        color: #ccc;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  .case-study__text {\n    font-size: 0.9rem;\n    line-height: 1.2;\n    background-color: #2f2f2f;\n    padding: 8px;\n    margin-top: 16px;\n    border-radius: 6px;\n  }\n}\n</style>\n","import { render } from \"./CaseStudy.vue?vue&type=template&id=f5a63290&scoped=true\"\nimport script from \"./CaseStudy.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./CaseStudy.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport \"./CaseStudy.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=f5a63290&lang=scss&scoped=true\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"D:\\\\dev\\\\google-cloud-developer-quiz\\\\node_modules\\\\vue-loader\\\\dist\\\\exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render],['__scopeId',\"data-v-f5a63290\"]])\n\nexport default __exports__","import { render } from \"./TheQuestion.vue?vue&type=template&id=414cb162&scoped=true\"\nimport script from \"./TheQuestion.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./TheQuestion.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport \"./TheQuestion.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=414cb162&lang=scss&scoped=true\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"D:\\\\dev\\\\google-cloud-developer-quiz\\\\node_modules\\\\vue-loader\\\\dist\\\\exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render],['__scopeId',\"data-v-414cb162\"]])\n\nexport default __exports__","export default [\n  {\n    number: 1,\n    text: 'You want to upload files from an on-premises virtual machine to Google Cloud Storage as part of a data migration.
